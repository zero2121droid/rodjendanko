Serializers vs Views

ðŸ§© The Main Difference:

Django Views	                                                Django Serializers
Handle incoming HTTP requests and return responses	            Convert data to/from JSON (or other formats)
Define what logic happens when a request is made	            Define how data should be structured
Usually include routing logic (GET, POST, PUTâ€¦)	                Usually include validation and formatting
Think: "What to do when a user visits an endpoint?"	            Think: "How to represent and validate this data?"
ðŸŽ¯ Example Analogy

Imagine you have a form to book a birthday party:

View is like the person handling the form: they receive it, check what's needed, and respond.
Serializer is like the instructions on how to fill the form and how to interpret it: it says which fields are required, what format they must be in, and how to store/read that info.
